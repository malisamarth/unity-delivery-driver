Simply pick deliveries and drop off at the location!!

Delivery Driving Game
•	Developed a game where we control a car. The main game loop involves retrieving the delivery package and delivering it to the designated location.
•	It is a 2D game that has “sprite” assets like houses, trees, a car, rocks, and roads.
•	The game has core fundamental concepts of Unity, such as Triggers, collision, and basic object acceleration and deceleration.
•	The triggers help build logic when the car is has touched the package and it has been picked and eventually delivered.
•	There are multiple speed boosters on the map where the vehicle speed drops until you hit a speed booster
•	Learned about the C# public and private initializations, references, methods, and serialized fields.
•	Implemented user input management in real time, which controls the car.
